"""The late pages' merge (gpu/vk/vk_memory.cpp, "the late copy's merge"): the fill pages of a write-back are snapshotted
from the shadow right after the fill and before the diff patches it; in the submission that uses the capture, the
write-back's own diff (shaders/wb_diff.comp, its word path) runs with that snapshot as its shadow and the capture's slot as
its guest. It writes the diff's words, and the capture's bytes at the words the diff did not change, stay.

Window (a): a CPU write between the capture and the write-back's fill lands in the fill (and so in the shadow the diff
compares) but not in the capture: the merge keeps the captured bytes there. Window (b): a page the write-back knew, with no
fill, has no snapshot: its post-diff shadow is no reference for the capture, and the plan sends it to the CPU wait.

The word path writes its shadow (s) as well as its guest, so each merge runs on its own copy of the shared snapshot: two
captures of the same write-back must both see the pre-diff words, and neither merge may patch what the other compares.
